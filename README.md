# NFT-preview-card-component
HTML/CSS frontendmentor.io challenge


I was able to use my new css grid skills with this challenge.  I didn't focus on making the website responsive  and that will be a emphasis of mine in the future.

Built with Semantic HTML5 markup CSS custom properties Flexbox 

What I learned This project help me with my css/flexbox. 

This was my first project from scratch, so as you can imagine it took me some time and was very stressful.

I plan on working on a project everyday. I start my Cohort January 24th and want to make sure I am prepared.
